\chapter{Motivation}

This project is a extension of work done during my Bachelor thesis project. As such, much of the process will remain the same.
The goal during my thesis project was to create a variety of prediction models in order to create a tool able to predict binding affinity
of newly synthesized molecules against 5-HT$_{6}$ receptor. The project consisted of the following pipeline:

        \begin{itemize}
                \item Data selection
                \item Data curation (standardization)
                \item Encoding molecular structure into fingerprints
                \item Creating classification and regression models using
                        \begin{itemize}
                                \item SVM (Support Vector Machine)
                                \item GBM (Gradient Boosting Machine)
                                \item Random Forest
                                \item Neural network models using Sklearn Multi-layer perceptron
                                \item Deep-learning models using DeepChem
                        \end{itemize}
                \item Assessing model accuracy
                \item Predicting activity of newly synthesized molecules
        \end{itemize}

In this project, I'd like to extend on my previous work by applying acquired experience and building more sofisticated models as well as more rigorous analysis of results.
