# serotonin_receptor_project

This is a mini-project to help me practice/learn data analysis and visualization techniques as well
machine learning methods.

## Goal
The goal is to extend on the work done during bachelor thesis project
and create a reliable prediction model for 5-HT6 receptor ligands
activity and physico-chemical properties.

## Tasks
The primary task is to create a variaty of prediction models and test
them against already existing ligands to asses their accuracy.
Secondary task is to use CReM to generate new ligands and use created
prediction models to asses their activity and properties.

## Steps
1. Gather data from public databases (chembl, pubchem)
2. Clean and prepare data (should contain Ki)
3. Prepare prediction models (classification and regression models)
4. Asses prediction models
